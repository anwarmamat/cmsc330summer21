# Project 2a: OCaml Warmup

CMSC 330, Summer 2021

Due June 18 (late June 19 *10% penalty*)

Points: 65 public, 20 semipublic, 15 secret

**This is an individual assignment. You must work on this project alone.**

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to get you familiar with programming in OCaml. You will have to write a number of small functions, each of which is specified in three sections below.

We recommend you get started right away, going from top to bottom. The problems get increasingly more challenging, and in some cases later problems can take advantage of earlier solutions.

### Ground Rules

In your code, you may **only** use library functions found in the [`Stdlib` module](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Stdlib.html). (This means you may **not** use the `List` module!) You may **not** use any imperative structures of OCaml such as references.

### Testing & Submitting

You will submit this project to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/171498/assignments/667131).  You may only submit the **basics.ml** file.  

To test locally, run `dune runtest -f` from the `setup` directory. We recommend you write student tests in `test/student/student.ml`.

You can interactively test your code by doing `dune utop src` (assuming you have `utop`). Then you should be able to use any of the functions. All of your commands in `utop` need to end with two semicolons (i.e. `;;`), otherwise it will appear that your terminal is hanging.

Besides the provided public tests, you will also find the file **student.ml** on `test/student/`, where you'll be able to add OUnit tests of your own. More detailed information about writing tests can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C36JnAcClOQ). Here are the timestamps for the topics covered in the video:

This project also includes [Property-based tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfaNEebCDos) (PBT) for you to use. Property based testing enables pretty good test coverage without having to write a lot of individual tests. In particular, you specify a **property** that your code should have on many possible inputs, not just a particular one, and the property tester will generate lots of random inputs against which to test the property.

The property-based tests (PBTs) we've provided are not meant to test your code entirely, but rather to give you a little help. You should still write your own tests. You can write typical unit tests (and/or test using `utop` or the `ocaml` top level), or if you like you can write more PBTs. You can find the provided PBTs in `test/property-based-test`, along with comments and instructions on how to expand them. We'll cover PBTs in more detail later in the class, so don't feel obligated to play with these now.

### Project Files

The following are the relevant files for your code:

- OCaml Files
    - **src/basics.ml**: You will **write your code here**, in this file. 
    - **src/basics.mli**: This file is used to describe the signature of all the functions in the module.  *Do not modify this file*; Gradescope will use the original version.

### Notes on OCaml

OCaml is a lot different than languages you're likely used to working with, and we'd like to point out a few quirks here that may help you work your way out of common issues with the language.

- Unlike most other languages, = in OCaml is the operator for structural equality whereas == is the operator for physical equality. All functions in this project (and in this course, unless ever specified otherwise) are concerned with *structural* equality.
- The binary subtraction operator (`-`) also doubles as the unary minus operator for `int`s and `float`s in OCaml. As a result, the parser has trouble identifying the difference between subtraction and a negative number. When writing negative numbers, it's safest to surround them in parentheses; e.g., `some_function 5 (-10)` works, where `some_function 5 -10` will give an error.
- Recursive functions in OCaml require the use of the `rec` keyword. We don't include the `rec` keyword for certain functions in `basics.ml` to show that the function can be written without recursion. Adding `rec` to a non-recursive function usually has no effect (unless there is some sort of shadowing going on).

### Important Notes about this Project

1. Some parts of this project are additive, meaning your solutions to earlier functions can be used to aid in writing later functions. Think about this in part 3.
2. You can always add a helper function for any of the functions we ask you to implement, and the helper function can also be recursive.
3. You may move around the function definitions. In OCaml, in order to use one function inside of another, you need to define the function before it is called. For example, if you think that a function from Part 2 can be used to help you implement a function in Part 1, you can move your implementation of the function from the Part 2 section to before the function in Part 1. As long as you still pass the tests and you haven't created a syntax error, you are fine.
4. Pay special notice to a function's type. Often times, you can lose sight of what you're trying to do if you don't remind yourself of the types of the arguments  and the type of what you're trying to return.
5. You may rename arguments however you would like, but **do not modify function's name**. Doing so will cause you to fail the function's tests.

## Part 1: Non-Recursive Functions

Implement the following functions that do not require recursion. Accordingly, these functions are defined without the `rec` keyword, but **you MAY add the `rec` keyword to any of the following functions or write a recursive helper function**. Just remember that if you write a helper function, it must be defined in the file before it is called.

#### `rev_tup tup`

- **Type**: `'a * 'b * 'c -> 'c * 'b * 'a`
- **Description**: Returns a 3-tuple in the reverse order of `tup`.
- **Examples**:
   ```ocaml
   rev_tup (1, 2, 3) = (3, 2, 1)
   rev_tup (1, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1)
   rev_tup ("a", 1, "c") = ("c", 1, "a")
   ```

#### `abs x`

- **Type**: `int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the absolute value of `x`.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  abs 1 = 1
  abs (-5) = 5
  ```

#### `area p q`

- **Type**: `int * int -> int * int -> int`
- **Description**: Takes in the Cartesian coordinates (2-dimensional) of any pair of opposite corners of a rectangle and returns the area of the rectangle. The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  area (1, 1) (2, 2) = 1
  area (2, 2) (1, 1) = 1
  area (2, 1) (1, 2) = 1
  area (0, 1) (2, 3) = 4
  area (1, 1) (1, 1) = 0
  area ((-1), (-1)) (1, 1) = 4
  ```

#### `volume x y`

- **Type**: `int * int * int -> int * int * int -> int`
- **Description**: Takes in the Cartesian coordinates (3-dimensional) of two opposite corners of a rectangular prism and returns its volume. The sides of the rectangular prism are parallel to the axes.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  volume (1, 1, 1) (2, 2, 2) = 1
  volume (2, 2, 2) (1, 1, 1) = 1
  volume (0, 1, 2) (2, 3, 5) = 12
  volume (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 1) = 0
  volume ((-1), (-1), (-1)) (1, 1, 1) = 8
  ```

## Part 2: Recursive Functions

Implement the following functions using recursion.

#### `fibonacci n`

- **Type**: `int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the `n`th term of the fibonacci sequence.
- **Assumptions**: `n` is non-negative, and we will **not** test your code for integer overflow cases.

  ```

#### `log x y`
- **Type**: `int -> int -> int`
- **Description**: Returns the log of `y` with base `x` rounded-down to an integer.
- **Assumptions**: You may assume the answer is non-negative, `x` >= 2, and `y` >= 1.
- **Examples**:
  ``` ocaml
  log 4 4 = 1
  log 4 16 = 2
  log 4 15 = 1
  log 4 64 = 3
  ```

#### `is_prime x`
- **Type**: `int -> bool`

  is_prime 2 = true
  is_prime 3 = true
  is_prime 4 = false
  is_prime 5 = true
  is_prime 60 = false
  is_prime 61 = true
  is_prime -2 = false
  ```

#### `next_prime x`

- **Type**: `int -> int`
- **Description**:  Returns the smallest prime number greater than or equal to `x`.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  next_prime 1 = 2
  next_prime 2 = 2
  next_prime 3 = 3
  next_prime 4 = 5
  next_prime 60 = 61
  next_prime -20 = 2
  ```

## Part 3: Lists

#### `get idx lst`

- **Type**: `int -> 'a list -> 'a`
- **Description**: Returns the element at the index `idx` in the list `lst`. If `idx` is past the bounds of `lst`, raise an error using `failwith "Out of bounds"`.
- **Assumptions**: `idx` is non-negative.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  get 0 [26; 11; 99] = 26
  get 1 [26; 11; 99] = 11
  get 2 [26; 11; 99] = 99
  get 3 [26; 11; 99] = Exception
  get 0 ["a"; "b"] = "a"
  get 1 ["a"; "b"] = "b"
  get 2 ["a"; "b"] = Exception
  ```

#### `larger lst1 lst2`

- **Type**: `'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Returns the longer list provided as an argument, returns the empty list if the two lists are the same length.

  larger [4; 1; 2] [3; 5; 7] = []
  ```

#### `reverse lst`

- **Type**: `'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Returns a list with the elements of `lst` but in reverse order.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  reverse [] = []
  reverse [1] = [1]
  reverse [1; 2; 3] = [3; 2; 1]
  reverse ["a"; "b"; "c"] = ["c"; "b"; "a"]
  ```

#### `combine lst1 lst2`

- **Type**: `'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Returns a list with the elements of `lst1` followed by the elements of `lst2`. The elements within each list must be in the same order.  You may **not** use the `@` operator to write this function (that is, in this function or any helper functions).
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  combine [] [] = []
  combine [] [3; 4] = [3; 4]
  combine [1; 2; 3; 4] [3; 4; 5] = [1; 2; 3; 4; 3; 4; 5]
  combine ["a"] ["b"] = ["a"; "b"]
  ```

#### `rotate shift lst`

- **Type**: `int -> 'a list -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Move every element over in `lst` to the left by the given `shift` (looping around).
- **Assumptions**: `shift` is non-negative.
- **Important Note**: None of the public or semipublic tests check whether this function works. Write your own tests to verify that your behavior is what you would expect!
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  rotate 0 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"]
  rotate 1 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["b"; "c"; "d"; "a"]
  rotate 2 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["c"; "d"; "a"; "b"]
  rotate 3 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["d"; "a"; "b"; "c"]
  rotate 4 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"]
  rotate 5 ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"] = ["b"; "c"; "d"; "a"]
  ```

#### `is_palindrome lst`

- **Type**: `'a list -> bool`
- **Description**: Returns true if `lst` is a palindrome and returns false otherwise. A palindrome is the same read forward and backward.
- **Important Note**: Use wildcards `_` to make sure all match cases are exhaustive.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  is_palindrome [] = true
  is_palindrome [1; 2; 3; 2; 1] = true
  is_palindrome ["A"; "b"; "b"; "A"] = true
  is_palindrome ["O", "C", "A", "M"; "L"] = false
  ```
